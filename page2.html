					Hodaka sees Hina being intimidated into working at a back-alley club.<br> 
					After a brief chase, he scares off the club owners by firing his gun into the air, <br>
					thinking it was a toy. <br>
					<br>
					He and Hina escape; she takes him to Yoyogi Kaikan,<br> 
					an abandoned building with a shrine on the roof, where he throws the gun away.<br>
					<br>
					Hina astonishes Hodaka by demonstrating her ability to clear the sky by praying.
